3D puzzle-action game created with Unity for GMTK Game Jam 2024

## Description
A mind-bending puzzle-action game about intelligence and fast decision-making.

You play as an employee at a powerful research corporation — one that seems to be hiding something dangerous. One day, a fellow worker grants you access to a prototype device capable of shrinking and enlarging objects, and safely infiltrating complex machinery. Through hidden logs and recordings, you uncover the company's terrifying plan: they intend to shrink the Moon itself. Determined to stop them, you descend into the heart of the facility. But the company is onto you — and they've sent security forces to eliminate the threat. Solve puzzles, outsmart enemies, explore a sprawling facility, and prevent a disaster that could doom all of humanity.
